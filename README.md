## ✅ Completed Assignment Tasks

### ✔️ 1. Angular App Setup

Initialized using standalone components, routing, and Angular CLI best practices.

### ✔️ 2. Component Creation

Created `missionlist`, `missiondetails`, and `missionfilter` components using `ng generate`.

### ✔️ 3. Mission List

Displays mission cards with image, name, rocket info, year, details, and links.

### ✔️ 4. Filtering

Sidebar filters to dynamically narrow down results using API query parameters.

### ✔️ 5. Mission Details Page

Click any mission to navigate to `/mission/:id` and display full details.

### ✔️ 6. Service Integration

All data is fetched from the public SpaceX API using a reusable Angular service.

### ✔️ 7. Interface/Type Structure

Mission data is typed using a custom `Launch` interface in `launch.interface.ts`.

### ✔️ 8. Angular Material Integration

Used `MatToolbar` from Angular Material to fulfill the design enhancement requirement. The rest of the UI was built using Bootstrap 5 for more custom control and flexibility.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The project uses standalone components — no traditional `AppModule` file.
- Bootstrap was chosen over Angular Material for its responsive grid system and visual polish.
- All filtering and routing is handled via Angular's built-in `HttpClient` and `Router`.
